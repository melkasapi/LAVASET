# LAVASET 


## TO DOUBLE-CHECK 
- gini calculation
<<<<<<< HEAD
- formate simulation data () does not pick up the formate peak (trees=100, nn=10) and picks up noise as important 
=======
- formate simulation data (`testing/formate_cluster_labels.txt`) does not pick up the formate peak (trees=100, nn=10) and picks up noise instead as important

  - check the `_build` function for progressing nodes    
  - increase the number of trees? 

## TO ADD 
- unittest folder 

## Wishlist 
- fix random number of samples to take the REAL indexes of samples (found on `_generate_sample_indexes()`).
